Some tips to debug this:
 - Launch the bluetooth dameon as "sudo  /usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd -d -n"
 - Using bluetoothctl
   - I had to set "agent on", "default-agent" and "trust 98:D6:F7:73:03:F1"
   - Having it running it will provide some information
 - /var/log/messages gives also some information about bluetoothd if you do not run it directly
 - run "sudo btmon > btmon.log" to get information from the devices that try to connect to the computer
   - This is very useful to see to which uuid is trying to connect and what kind of errors it gets
